## Overview

Starting from v1.3, this training operator provides Kubernetes custom resources that makes it easy to
run distributed or non-distributed TensorFlow/PyTorch/Apache MXNet/XGBoost/MPI jobs on Kubernetes.

> Note: Before v1.2 release, Kubeflow Training Operator only supports TFJob on Kubernetes.

- For a complete reference of the custom resource definitions, please refer to the API Definition.

  - [PyTorch API Definition](pkg/apis/kubeflow.org/v1/pytorch_types.go)
  - [Apache MXNet API Definition](pkg/apis/kubeflow.org/v1/mxnet_types.go)
  - [XGBoost API Definition](pkg/apis/kubeflow.org/v1/xgboost_types.go)
  - [MPI API Definition](pkg/apis/kubeflow.org/v1/mpi_types.go)

## Prerequisites

- Version >= 1.23 of Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl`

## Installation

### Master Branch

```bash
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/manifests/overlays/standalone"
```

### Stable Release

## Acknowledgement

This project was originally started as a distributed training operator for TensorFlow and later we merged efforts from other Kubeflow training operators to provide a unified and simplified experience for both users and developers. We are very grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and answered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions. We'd also like to thank everyone who's contributed to and maintained the original operators.
