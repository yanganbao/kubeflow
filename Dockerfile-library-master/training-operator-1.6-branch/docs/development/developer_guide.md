# Developer Guide

Kubeflow Training Operator is currently at v1.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/) (1.17 or later)

## Building the operator

Create a symbolic link inside your GOPATH to the location you checked out the code

```sh
mkdir -p ${go env GOPATH}/src/github.com/kubeflow
ln -sf ${GIT_TRAINING} ${go env GOPATH}/src/github.com/kubeflow/training-operator
```

- GIT_TRAINING should be the location where you checked out https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator

Install dependencies

```sh
go mod vendor
```

Build it

```sh
go install github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/cmd/training-operator.v1
```

## Running the Operator Locally

Running the operator locally (as opposed to deploying it on a K8s cluster) is convenient for debugging/development.

### Run a Kubernetes cluster

First, you need to run a Kubernetes cluster locally. There are lots of choices:

- [local-up-cluster.sh in Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/local-up-cluster.sh)
- [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)

`local-up-cluster.sh` runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally, but Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. It is all compilable with the controller, but the Kubernetes version should be `1.8` or above.

Notice: If you use `local-up-cluster.sh`, please make sure that the kube-dns is up, see [kubernetes/kubernetes#47739](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47739) for more details.

### Configure KUBECONFIG and KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE

We can configure the operator to run locally using the configuration available in your kubeconfig to communicate with
a K8s cluster. Set your environment:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=$(echo ~/.kube/config)
export KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE=$(your_namespace)
```

- KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE is used when deployed on Kubernetes, we use this variable to create other resources (e.g. the resource lock) internal in the same namespace. It is optional, use `default` namespace if not set.

### Create the TFJob CRD

After the cluster is up, the TFJob CRD should be created on the cluster.

```bash
make install
```

### Run Operator

Now we are ready to run operator locally:

```sh
make run
```

To verify local operator is working, create an example job and you should see jobs created by it.

```sh
cd ./examples/v1/dist-mnist
docker build -f Dockerfile -t kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0 .
kubectl create -f ./tf_job_mnist.yaml
```

## Go version

On ubuntu the default go package appears to be gccgo-go which has problems see [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15429) golang-go package is also really old so install from golang tarballs instead.

## Generate Python SDK

To generate Python SDK for the operator, run:

```
./hack/python-sdk/gen-sdk.sh
```

This command will re-generate the api and model files together with the documentation and model tests.
The following files/folders in `sdk/python` are auto-generated and should not be modified directly:

```
sdk/python/docs
sdk/python/kubeflow/training/models
sdk/python/kubeflow/training/*.py
sdk/python/test/*.py
```

The Training Operator client and public APIs are located here:

```
sdk/python/kubeflow/training/api
```

## Code Style

### Python

- Use [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format Python code
- `yapf` style is configured in `.style.yapf` file
- To autoformat code

  ```sh
  yapf -i py/**/*.py
  ```

- To sort imports

  ```sh
  isort path/to/module.py
  ```
